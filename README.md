# The Northern Arizona University Energy Dashboard

### Overview
Our sponsors are looking to make the most of NAU’s energy data. This project is sponsored by Jonathan Heitzinger and Dr. Truong Nghiem. Together they are looking to develop a web-based system which analyzes and elegantly presents NAU’s building operation data. They hope to create a product that impacts campus-wide sustainability. To facilitate the collection and analyzation of NAU’s energy data, we are developing the NAU Energy Dashboard.

The NAU Energy Dashboard is a comprehensive web-based application which can retrieve, graphically display, export, and run basic analytics on NAU’s collected data. We plan to simplify the existing process with a tool that abstracts away the complexities that stifle current research efforts. Our users would like the NAU Energy Dashboard to:

* Automatically handle building operation data retrieval.
* Graphically display data in a way that is interactive.
* Run applicable broad statistics on a wide range of data points.
* Cleanly export mutable CSV files for additional analysis.

This solution eliminates the need for sifting through endless data, presenting data using external tools, and using specialized tools for fundamental statistical analyses.
