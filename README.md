# The Northern Arizona University Energy Dashboard

## Overview
This project is sponsored by Jonathan Heitzinger and Dr. Truong Nghiem. Together they are looking to develop a web-based system which analyzes and elegantly presents NAU’s building operation data. They hope to create a product that impacts campus-wide sustainability. To facilitate the collection and analyzation of NAU’s energy data, we are developing the NAU Energy Dashboard.

The NAU Energy Dashboard is a comprehensive web-based application which can retrieve, graphically display, export, and run basic analytics on NAU’s collected data. We plan to simplify the existing process with a tool that abstracts away the complexities that stifle current research efforts. Our users would like the NAU Energy Dashboard to:

* Automatically handle building operation data retrieval.
* Graphically display data in a way that is interactive.
* Run applicable broad statistics on a wide range of data points.
* Cleanly export mutable CSV files for additional analysis.

This solution eliminates the need for sifting through endless data, presenting data using external tools, and using specialized tools for fundamental statistical analyses.

## Previews

#### Homepage
This is where it all starts. Aggregate Campus data is presented here as well as everything a user needs to navigate through our site.

#### Exporting Data
Here users are able to download data as a .CSV file. They simply select data from a sensor or about a specific utility and the rest is as simple as a click of a button!

#### Viewing a Building
Users can visit a page about each building on campus. Here they can see data regarding any of the building's sensors and utilities.
